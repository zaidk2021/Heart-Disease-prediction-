# Heart Disease Prediction

Part of ACM Kaggle Competition MIT MANIPAL by Zaid Khan

## Overview
This project aims to predict heart disease based on various features. It was developed as part of the ACM Kaggle Competition at MIT MANIPAL. The libraries used in the project are listed in the accompanying txt files, which provide details about the techniques employed.

## Key Points to Explore
- **When to use Random Forest**:
  - Discuss scenarios where Random Forest is a suitable choice for classification tasks, such as its ability to handle noisy data and feature importance analysis.
  
- **Choosing between Grid Search CV, Random Search, and Bayesian Search Optimization**:
  - Compare and contrast these hyperparameter tuning methods, highlighting their advantages and when to use each based on factors like dataset size, computation resources, and search space.

- **SMOTE vs ADASYN**:
  - Explain the differences between SMOTE and ADASYN for handling imbalanced datasets, and discuss when each method might be more appropriate based on the characteristics of the dataset and the desired balance of classes.

- **Visualization for Preprocessing**:
  - Explore the use of visualization techniques for understanding preprocessing tasks, such as data distribution analysis, missing value detection, and feature correlation analysis.

- **Column Transformer**:
  - Discuss the purpose of column transformers in preprocessing pipelines and when to use them for handling different types of features (e.g., numerical, categorical).

- **Label Encoder vs One-Hot Encoder**:
  - Explain the differences between label encoding and one-hot encoding for handling categorical variables, and discuss when each encoding method should be used based on the nature of the data and the requirements of the machine learning algorithm.

- **Choosing between XGBoost and Light GBM**:
  - Compare the features and performance of XGBoost and Light GBM algorithms, discussing factors such as speed, memory usage, and performance on different types of datasets.

- **Challenges with ADASYN and Multiclass**:
  - Discuss why ADASYN may not work well with multiclass classification problems, citing any limitations or challenges encountered.
- **What are regularization techniques**:
